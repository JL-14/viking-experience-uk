## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color Palette](/documentation/images/colour-palette.png)

- A soft light brown colour was chosen as the main background colour, as psychologically it is associated with warmth, nature, earthiness, reliability, and support. These properties match the theme of the website, which provides outdoor experiences and work with natural materials.

- A warm medium brown colour was used for the title and logo, for the same reasons as the main background colour, providing a middle contrast between the background and font colours.

- A darker brown colour was used for fonts, headings and borders, chosen as it matches and provides good contrast against the background colour.

- A slightly brighter light brown colour was chosen for the contact form boxes, to make the boxes stand out clearly against the background colour, and encourage action for these sections.

### Typography

![Main Font](/documentation/images/font-sourcesanspro.png)

- Source Sans Pro was used as the main font for the website as it provides good readability and works well with the header font.

![Title font](/documentation/images/font-josefinsans.png)

- Josefin Sans was used for titles and headers as it has a Nordic appearance (with sharper edges than the main font), is legible and goes well with the theme of the website.

### Wireframe

![Wireframe for website](/documentation/images/balsamiq-wireframes.pdf)

- The wireframe for the website was greated using the Balsamiq wireframe tool, creating an initial outline of the website. The initial design was further developed as the website was realised, but the core concept and design remains consistent.

### Validator Testing

---
+ ### HTML
#### Home Page
- No errors or warnings were found when W3C Validator was employed.

![Home Page HTML Validator](/documentation/images/w3c-validator-home-100623.png)

#### Packages Page
- No errors or warnings were found when W3C Validator was employed.

![Packages Page HTML Validator](/documentation/images/w3c-validator-packages-100623.png)

#### Contact Page

- No errors or warnings were found when W3C Validator was employed.

![Contact Page HTML Validator](/documentation/images/w3c-validator-contact-100623.png)

#### Terms and Conditions Page

- No errors or warnings were found when W3C Validator was employed.

![Terms and Conditions Page HTML Validator](/documentation/images/w3c-validator-t-and-c-100623.png)

#### Thank You Page

- No errors or warnings were found when W3C Validator was employed.

![Thank You Page HTML Validator](/documentation/images/w3c-validator-thankyou-100623.png)

+ ### CSS

- No errors were found when W3C CSS Validator was employed.

![CSS Page Validator](/documentation/images/w3c-css-validator-100623.png)

- There were 5 warnings in the W3C CSS Validator was run.

![CSS Page Validator Warnings](/documentation/images/w3c-css-validator-warnings-100623.png)

- The warnings all relate to embedded content on the website, and on testing with Firefox and Chrome browsers were not found to affect performance.

+ ### Performance
- Using Lighthouse in DevTools on the Chrome browser I checked the performance aspects of the site.

#### Home Page

![Home Page Lighthouse](/documentation/images/lighthouse-home.png)

#### Packages Page

![Packages Page Lighthouse](/documentation/images/lighthouse-packages.png)

#### Contact Page

![Contact Page Lighthouse](/documentation/images/lighthouse-contact.png)

#### Terms and Conditions Page

![Terms and Conditions Page Lighthouse](/documentation/images/lighthouse-tandc.png)

#### Thank You Page

![Thank You Page Lighthouse](/documentation/images/lighthouse-thankyou.png)

- Scores were good across the board, but the performance scores were lower than the ideal, due to the use of JPEG images on the website. In future versions the images will be replaced by more compressed image formats to improve performance scores. On testing with Chrome and Firefox browsers the performance was unproblematic and did not affect my use of the website.

+ ### Accessibility Testing

- The accessibility of the website for visitors with assistive technologies or other impairments was tested using the Google WAVE extension. 

- After making some adjustments to increase contrast, there were no accessibility errors, with some warnings about the length of some ARIA-label descriptions (the descriptions being on the long side) which I decided do not impair the accessibility of the website.

![Home Page WAVE](/documentation/images/wave-home.png)

#### Packages Page

![Packages Page WAVE](/documentation/images/wave-packages.png)

#### Contact Page

## Bugs

### Existing Bugs

1. There is a warning in DevTools on Chrome and Firefox browsers stating that: 

"DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://fheoggkfdfchfphceeifdbepaooicaho/sourceMap/chrome/scripts/content_autoplay_detection.js.map: System error: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT"

- The warning relates to the embedded Google Map in the Location section on the Home Page, and does not affect performance.

2. The W3C CSS Validator returned five warnings relating to external third-party content in the code, none of which affect the user experience.

3. On the very smallest screen sizes the word 'experiences' in the semi-transparent cover text box exceeds the background container, with the 'e' and the 's' appearing on or just outside the edge. 

- The issue does not disrupt user experience, and will be addressed in future versions.

4. The image-types (especially .jpeg) affect overall performance, without negatively affecting the user experience.

- Lower resolution images, or images of a performance-friendly nature (e.g. .webp images) will be used in future versions.

### Solved Bugs
- A number of bugs were solved throughout the design of the website, on a running basis.

- The greatest number of bugs related to the use of flex-boxes, and were resolved through changing display types and layouts.

- There were also bugs related to the use of fixed heights affecting the responsivity of the website, solved through replacing with relative values.

---

## Future Improvements

* further refine responsive design elements to improve appearance on the smallest screens (especially small mobiles)
* refine the images used, both in terms of file-types and placement on the Packages page
* add an up-to-date availability checker and the ability to book and pay online on the website
* add a custom 404 Error page
