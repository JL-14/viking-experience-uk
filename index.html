        <h3>Have you ever wondered what life was like as a Viking arriving in the UK?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Vikings arrived from Scandinavia in the 8th century AD, famously ransacking the monastry
            and settlement on Holy Island, Lindisfarne, in 793 AD. They travelled across the North Sea
            in open longships carrying everything they needed for raiding, and also for establishing 
            settlements across much of the country. In 840 AD they arrived in Norfolk, and when King 
            Edmund of East Anglia was killed in battle at Hoxne in Suffolk in 869/70 AD, East Anglia 
            became a Viking kingdom (the Danelaw).</p>
        <br>
        <p>So what was life like for Vikings arriving in the UK? Travelling first in longboats, 
            then coming ashore and establishing camps and eventually settlements? 
            The Viking Experience UK has recreated that experience, including seafaring in a longboat, 
            setting up camp with Viking style materials, cooking and eating like the Vikings, 
            and taking part in activities enjoyed by the Scandinavians whilst in camp. 
            The experiences on offer range from single days exploring aspects such as seafaring 
            or setting up camp, or multi-day experiences recreating the landing and excursions inland, 
            with camping and experience of a recreated Viking settlement.</p>

        <div id="location">
            <p>Our base camp is located on the Isle of Flegg, where the Vikings first set foot in Norfolk. 
            The camp, near Winterton-on-Sea, consists of our main reception, changing rooms (as you will be 
            given Viking Age outfits to wear during the experience), and safe storage of items you do not 
            wish to take with you. There are refreshments available for purchase at the main building, 
            as well as a shop for souvenirs from your time as a Viking.  There is ample parking on site.</p>
