    <h2><strong>Viking Experience Packages</strong></h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>The Viking Experience UK offers three set packages designed to give you a flavour of what it 
            was like for the Vikings arriving and settling in the UK. Each package covers a separate aspect
            of Viking life, including life at sea, life at camp, and the arts and crafts (and games) the Vikings 
            used in their everyday life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>There are some elements that are common to all three experiences, such as:</p> 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food and cooking</strong> -we will
                cook and eat as the Vikings did -although you are welcome to bring your own food and drink to cater 
                for preferences and dietary requirements)</li>
                <li><strong>Clothing</strong> -you will be provided with a set of Viking-style clothing including 
                a tunic, breeches, headdress, and belts and other accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons</strong> -you will again be provided with Viking weapons appropriate to your activity 
                (even if murder and pillaging is strictly off the agenda!)</li>
        <br>
        <p><strong>So whatever takes your fancy, come and explore like a Viking!</strong></p>

    <p>The Vikings were expert ship builders, with ships capable of crossing the North Sea, the North Atlantic,
        and even the Mediterranean. Whilst they had a range of different types of ship, the most famous is the longship. 
        The longship had a unique structure, with a long, narrow hull and a relatively flat bottom, making the ships seaworthy 
        on the high seas and shallow waters alike. The longships were often decorated with carvings, including the 
        well-known dragon-head on the prow of the ship.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        At the Viking Experience UK we have an authentic Viking ship building yard, and two replica longships (built
        using Viking ship building techniques as far as possible), the Tanngrisnir and the Tanngnjostr -named after the goats that pulled Thor's chariot 
        across the sky.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We offer you the opportunity to experience what it was like to be at sea in one of these ships as part of the 
        Seafaring Experience. The experience involves an introduction to the Vikings and their life at sea, a
        safety briefing, and then we head out to the ships. We will row out from the shore, and set sail once we are 
        clear of the shoreline. From the camp we will sail north along the Norfolk coast, and land for lunch at a suitable location,
        making the most of the longship's design that enables us to get right up to shore.
        For those who are so inclined, a full Viking raid landing can be arranged, leaping over the sides to storm onto shore 
        with weapons and shields at the ready. After lunch we set sail again (or row depending on the winds), and return to 
        camp.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For the Seafaring Experience you will be provided with full Viking attire including weapons and shields, and not so Vikingey life-vests (which are non-optional!).
        We recommend that you wear waterproof clothing under the viking outfits, as these are open longships, and
        spray, waves, and rain are all possible during the outing. The trips go ahead except in extreme weather (wind and waves),
        and in the event that the trip cannot go-ahead you will be given the option of a refund or to re-book another date.
