    <h2><strong>Viking Experience Packages</strong></h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>The Viking Experience UK offers three set packages designed to give you a flavour of what it 
            was like for the Vikings arriving and settling in the UK. Each package covers a separate aspect
            of Viking life, including life at sea, life at camp, and the arts and crafts (and games) the Vikings 
            used in their everyday life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>There are some elements that are common to all three experiences, such as:</p> 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food and cooking</strong> -we will
                cook and eat as the Vikings did -although you are welcome to bring your own food and drink to cater 
                for preferences and dietary requirements)</li>
                <li><strong>Clothing</strong> -you will be provided with a set of Viking-style clothing including 
                a tunic, breeches, headdress, and belts and other accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons</strong> -you will again be provided with Viking weapons appropriate to your activity 
                (even if murder and pillaging is strictly off the agenda!)</li>
        <br>
        <p><strong>So whatever takes your fancy, come and explore like a Viking!</strong></p>

    <p>The Vikings were expert ship builders, with ships capable of crossing the North Sea, the North Atlantic,
        and even the Mediterranean. Whilst they had a range of different types of ship, the most famous is the longship. 
        The longship had a unique structure, with a long, narrow hull and a relatively flat bottom, making the ships seaworthy 
        on the high seas and shallow waters alike. The longships were often decorated with carvings, including the 
        well-known dragon-head on the prow of the ship.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        At the Viking Experience UK we have an authentic Viking ship building yard, and two replica longships (built
        using Viking ship building techniques as far as possible), the Tanngrisnir and the Tanngnjostr -named after the goats that pulled Thor's chariot 
        across the sky.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We offer you the opportunity to experience what it was like to be at sea in one of these ships as part of the 
        Seafaring Experience. The experience involves an introduction to the Vikings and their life at sea, a
        safety briefing, and then we head out to the ships. We will row out from the shore, and set sail once we are 
        clear of the shoreline. From the camp we will sail north along the Norfolk coast, and land for lunch at a suitable location,
        making the most of the longship's design that enables us to get right up to shore.
        For those who are so inclined, a full Viking raid landing can be arranged, leaping over the sides to storm onto shore 
        with weapons and shields at the ready. After lunch we set sail again (or row depending on the winds), and return to 
        camp.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For the Seafaring Experience you will be provided with full Viking attire including weapons and shields, and not so Vikingey life-vests (which are non-optional!).
        We recommend that you wear waterproof clothing under the viking outfits, as these are open longships, and
        spray, waves, and rain are all possible during the outing. The trips go ahead except in extreme weather (wind and waves),
        and in the event that the trip cannot go-ahead you will be given the option of a refund or to re-book another date.

    <p>Once ashore, the Viking incursion took on a very different nature from that on sea. The Vikings
        travelled with everything they needed for setting up camp after a successful landing, including tents,
        tools for repairing weapons and equipment, food and provisions. They would also carry medical supplies 
        for tending to anyone wounded in any initial encounters with the locals.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The Viking Camp package lets you experience what it was like to land ashore, establish a foothold, and 
        then proceed inland to set up camp using Viking Age tents and materials. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For the Camp experience, we will start at the main camp (our reception centre), and after a general talk about Viking life we will have a safety briefing.
        After the briefing we will proceed to one of the longships waiting at the shore, and row a short distance north along the Norfolk coast before landing at a suitable location.
        The first task will be to establish a foothold (there may be guards patrolling the shore!), after which we will unload what we need 
        for our incursion. We will divide the equipment, and set off in search of somewhere to set up camp (approximately a two-mile walk from the landing site).
        Once at the site we will set up camp, including pitching tents, getting a fire going, and sharing tasks 
        such as cooking, tending to the wounded, repairing equipment, and eventually settling down for some
        Viking style leisure activities, such as games and weapons and battle practice. In the evening we will have a good meal
        cooked over the fire, before retiring to the tents for the night. The next day we will pack up camp, and 
        set out on the next leg of the journey (approximately five miles) which will take us back to base.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For the Camp Experience you will be provided with Viking attire and weapons, as well as everything needed to set up camp. 
        We recommend that you wear appropriate clothing under your Viking clothes, taking into account the possibility of rain and spray from 
        the journey to the landing area, and in line with general temperature and weather forecasts. If in doubt, do contact us and
        we will be happy to advise on suitable clothing. The food will be meat and vegetables (cooked over the open fire), and Viking style hot drinks 
        (tea and coffee will also be available), but you are of course welcome to bring other foods to cater for likes and dietary requirements. 
        Sleeping arrangements will be two-five people per tent, and you will share with others in your party. We will
        contact you before arranging for anyone outside your party to share tent should that be necessary. The trip will go ahead unless there is extreme weather (wind, rain, 
        other weather-related events), in which case you can request a refund or re-book onto another date.
